            <h2>Daniel F. Corrin</h2>
            <p class="about-subhead">Mediator &amp; Arbitrator</p>
            <p>
              Daniel Corrin worked as a trial lawyer for more than 25 years. His litigation practice focused on
              complex cases for catastrophically injured individuals. Before transitioning to dispute resolution,
              Daniel was a Partner at Parsons Corrin LLP, before that, the principal lawyer at Brain &amp; Injury
              Law where he built a distinguished career. His extensive litigation experience most often involved
              mild, moderate, and severe traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord injuries, medical malpractice, and
              complex injury claims. The longest trial ran for 103 trial days. Many of the cases involved multi
              parties &amp; multiple lawyers of insurance. He dealt with individuals and families from all walks of
              life. He has had many multi-million-dollar judgments, and many more settlements. His experience
              provides him a clear, firsthand understanding of litigation risk, evidentiary challenges, family
              dynamics and the costs—financial and personal—of prolonged litigated disputes. A select list of
              Daniel’s litigated cases can be found under the About section.
            </p>
            <p>
              Daniel decided to transition to a mediation and dispute resolution role after 20+ years, to assist
              those involved in litigated cases and commercial disputes. His practice is grounded in a deep
              understanding of both the legal system and the human impacts of heavy involvement in litigation.
              This experience allows him to guide parties toward thoughtful, practical, and lasting resolutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Daniel’s mediation work arises after decades of engagement with the brain injury, legal, and medical
              communities. He has provided voluntary legal assistance with many community brain injury
              organizations as well as other volunteer board service with Family Services of Vancouver. He has
              been deeply involved in education and professional development within the legal field. He served
              for over a decade on the Board of the Trial Lawyers Association of BC (TLABC) and another decade as
              the chair of the TLABC education. He organized legal conferences focused on injury law, medical-legal
              issues, medicine, ethics and complex dispute resolution.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a speaker and educator, Daniel presented at national and international conferences, including
              the International Mental Health and the Law conferences in Rome and Prague, as well as professional
              forums at Vancouver General Hospital, GF Strong Rehabilitation Centre, and the Pacific Coast Brain
              Injury Conference. He has written on legal and medical-legal issues and was an author of the
              Continuing Legal Education British Columbia Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Practice Manual.

              As a mediator Daniel brings a calm, structured, and empathetic approach to dispute resolution. He is
              known for his ability to listen carefully, understand the underlying interests of all parties, and
              help participants move beyond entrenched positions toward fair and workable outcomes. His years of
              direct engagement with injured individuals, families, professionals, and insurers have shaped a
              dispute resolution style that is respectful, informed, and deeply human.
